# Call Planner

## Collaborators
Cindy Kim

Other students interested in this idea and design are welcome! Looking towards working with 4-6 other programmers on this project.

## What and Why?
Call Planner is a mobile/web app that will help organize your online schedule. This app aims to help users track all of their scheduled calls from various videocalling applications (e.g. Zoom, GoogleMeets, Slack, etc.) in one place. Instead of hassling through emails and other websites to search for invitation links, this app will provide a compact and visually appealing menu that will display buttons capable of redirecting you straight to the call. Additionally, the app will automatically convert the scheduled meeting time to fit the user's time zone. Understanding your schedule and making calls on time will never be easier!

As the world has shifted to being online for students and workers alike, it is becoming increasingly difficult to maintain and manage an online schedule. Time zones are confusing, and different classes and clubs prefer to use different applications. Invitation links could have been sent through a myriad of ways (email, Announcements, messages, etc.) and it's impossible to keep track of it every time you have to attend a meeting. Hopefully, this app will help others understand and stick to their online schedule, and omit the extra hassle that comes with attending online meetings.

## For Whom?
This app can be used by virtually anyone, but will provide the most benefit to busy online users who attempt to manage a busy online schedule in their head. Typically, students and online workers (of any expertise) will find this app most helpful.

## How?
1. Create a meeting event:
  - Input "title"
  - Input "time" (should automatically be referring to user's timezone)
  - Input "link"
  - *Optional* Input "duration" (how long the meeting will go on for, so as it doesn't conflict with other subsequent     meetings)
  - *Optional* Input "org" (to specify what organization it's for: X Class, X Club, X Job)
  - Many other features... like color, repeatability, etc.
2. Add meeting event banner to menu. Should present a banner with a button to join the call.
  - Send a reminder about the meeting x hours and y minutes before it is scheduled to start. Default setting is 5         minutes before the meeting, but can be customizable and repeatable.
3. Add another meeting by creating more meeting events throughout the week, month, year, etc.
  - All the meetings are organized by day of the week and time. Monday will have its own category of meetings, all of     which go from top to bottom depending on which meeting is scheduled to be earlier.
4. Once meeting's duration is up or the meeting is finished, it will disappear from the menu.

Other specifications such as account and preferences are available. Additionally, creating a meeting event should also create a block for it to visually see in the Calendar. Thus, the user can easily see gaps of free time or chunks of busy meetings throughout the week.

## Scope
This application will function much like a planner, where calendar features are necessary. This includes: a visual component of the week with colored meeting blocks representing busy times. Additional features of the app could involve sharing meeting reminders through text or email, as well as providing tasks to do before each meeting.

With all of the elements combined, and given how many features this application will have, the scope of this project should comfortably fit the 4-6 programmer requirement. It will involve lots of both frontend and backend work, which can be divided among programmers in the team.
